{:.abstract}
Byzantine historiography is a genre of medieval Greek literature which is defined by the writing of history through the course of the medieval Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. The following seeks to explore the history of this Greek writing of history, chronologically following the individual historians and their works, and giving commentary on them, in order to reveal the general characters of these historians and their works, as well as to give insight into how Byzantine historiography has affected history writing more generally.


## The Procopian Era
Byzantine Historians can generally be classified into having come from distinct time periods. The first of these is the earlier, what will be henceforth called the "Procopian" period (~6th-7th c. CE). The Procopian period takes its name from Procopius, who is probably the most significant historian of this period. 

This significance comes in large part from the mysterious nature of his character and works. As Averil M. Cameron describes him, "Procopius has emerged as a sceptic, a cool observer of Christianity, sometimes a crypto-pagan, sometimes a nominal but detached Christian, but always rational and a free-thinker." One example of the difficulty to "pin down", so to speak, Procopius and his writing is his work, the anecdotal history titled *Secret History*, or in Greek, *Apókryphe Historía* (Ἀπόκρυφη Ἱστορία). As K. Adshead describes it, it is an "enigmatic document". This work paints a narrative of the reign of Justinian which was largely negative, with chapters having been given titles such as "Proving That Justinian and Theodora Were Actually Fiends in Human Form", "How All Roman Citizens Became Slaves", or even more comically "How Justinian Killed a Trillion People".

Another historian from this Procopian period is Agathias Scholasticus (Ἀγαθίας σχολαστικός), who had also been a poet. Agathias fits firmly into the Procopian period, as according once again to Averil Cameron, this time alongside one Alan Cameron, in his work, Agathias had "only included the work of contemporaries." This inclusion of Agathias into the Procopian period, however, does not mean that Procopius and Agathias necessarily agreed on the character of Justinian's reign. As Charles Pazdernik states "members of this group will speak approvingly (or not) of other
 members, even if they are not personally acquainted with them, in terms of the extent of an erudition which has little or nothing to do with the technical aspects of their official positions; see, for example, the remarks of... Agathias on Procopius". Just as today there is much scholarly disagreement on the characters of public figures, so too in sixth century Byzantium was there also this disagreement.
 
 The next, extremely important historian of this period is one Theophylact Simocatta (Θεοφύλακτος Σιμοκάττης). In a review for Theophylact's work, the *History*, Michael and Mary Whitby state that the work is "the most important single source for the last two decades of sixth-century
 Byzantine and Balkan history and is also indispensable for those years of Sassanian
 Persian history, namely, the reign of Emperor Mauricius (582-602)." Being that the *History* of Theophylact is so encompassing, giving insight into the happenings of three different regions of the world for twenty years, it reaches a contemporary audience with critical acclaim, being regarded as one of the most important primary sources of the late sixth century.
 
 Other historians at this time wrote not necessarily about secular matters such as the Byzantine state and its administration, but about religious matters, such as the history of the church. One such historian, and the last one of the Procopian period to be discussed, was one Evagrius Scholasticus (Εὐάγριος Σχολαστικός), who had written the *Ecclesiastical History* or *Historia Ecclesiastica*. This work documents the history of the Christian Church from the year 431 (marked by the occurence of the Council of Ephesus), to the year 594, the year which saw Evagrius's death. Being that apart from political affairs, religion was also a very important aspect of Eastern Roman public life, for the most part, it is also fitting that histories written at the time also be religious histories.

 ## 10th Century Constantinian Historiography
 
 After the Procopian period, and between the next period to discuss, there is less historiographical content to be discussed. However, despite the sparseness, generally, of historical writing at this time, there is one figure whom is to be discussed is the Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (Κωνσταντῖνος Πορφυρογέννητος). 
 
 Constantine VII is significant in that as historical writing in Byzantium had waned, he had commissioned the assembly of a fifty-three subject collection of the works of Greek authors spanning back to the ancient period. According to G. L. Huxley, "The scholarship of Constantine and of those who worked at his direction was... encyclopaedic: their main purpose was to preserve the learning of the past by making it more accessible." Furthermore, Huxley credits Constantine VII with preserving "numerous fragments of a universal history by Nikolaos of Damascus, the court historian of Herod the Great", as well as the work of otherwise lost or unknown historians such as Menander Protector. The preservation of the latter work, called *Excerpta de legationibus* or the "Excerpts on Embassies", are according once again to Huxley, "sources of worth for the diplomatic history of sixth-century Byzantium."

 ## The Comnenian/Polaiologan Era
 
 This era is named for two imperial dynasties of the Eastern Roman Empire. The first is that of the Comnenus family (Κομνηνός), and specifically Anna Comnena (Ἄννα Κομνηνή), the daughter of Alexius I Comnenus (Ἀλέξιος Α' Κομνηνός)(r. 1081-1118), the founder of the Comnenian dynasty. The second is that of the Palaeologus family (Παλαιολόγος), the ruling dynasty of Byzantium from 1259 until the fall of Constantinople and Eastern Roman Empire to the Ottomans in 1453. 
 
 Anna Comnena's most significant work is her *Alexiad* (Ἀλεξιάς), which accounts the reign of her father. E.R.A Sewter, in a review of the work being added to the *Penguin Classics* collection, calls it "one of the masterpieces of Byzantine literature and history, the biography of the Byzantine emperor Alexius Comnenus... including her famous account of the First Crusade." Therefore, this highly regarded work can be regarded as an example of Greek literature which falls under the genres of both history and biography.
 
 The next Comnenian historian is none other than the husband of Anna Comnena herself, one Nicephorus Bryennius (Νικηφόρος Βρυέννιος). In fact, besides Anna herself, Bryennius is next the next closest "Comnenian" historian, as the two worked in communion with one another. In describing Anna's Alexiad, T.C. Lounghis states the following, "The aim of the work is to record the deeds of her father, completing a history commissioned by Anna’s mother and begun by Bryennius." This does not mean, however, that Bryennius's intellectual capabilities were somehow dependent on or "piggybacking" off of those of his wife. According once again to Lounghis, John (Anna's brother and Byzantine emperor) felt threatened by Bryennius as he had viewed "Anna and her husband as a learned and formidable couple, and Bryennius in particular as so powerful" to the point of being particularly formidable in the eyes of John.
 
 The next of the Comnenian historians to be discussed is one John Cinnamus (Ἰωάννης Κίνναμος). According to Paul Stephenson, Anna Comnena largely kept from documenting the actions of her brother John under the reign of their father in her Alexiad. It is known, according to Stephenson, that Anna felt a deal of hostility toward her brother, as she describes him as having been "stupid", identifying her brother by acknowledging him as the one who had inherited Alexius's throne. This being the case, the work of John Cinnamus supplements, if only to a small degree, the Alexiad, as it fills in the gaps in knowledge intentionally by Anna Comnena. In fact Stephenson finds the work so reliable that he calls it "unbiased", and laments its length by describing it as "all too brief." It is unfortunate that such a valuable source be so short. However, it does reveal how topics which are covered (or not) by the original author(s) impact perceptions at large about the historical past, as much less is now known about John's life under Alexius than after his ascension to the throne, thereby potentially diminishing his importance under the reign of Alexius.
 
 A contemporary of Cinnamus is one Niketas Choniates (Νικήτας Χωνιάτης). The most significant work of Choniates is probably his *Historia*. According to Alicia J. Simpson, it "is the single most important source for the crucial era in Byzantine history that begins with the death of Alexios I Komnenos in 1118 and culminates with the capture of Constantinople by the armies of the Fourth Crusade in 1204," being the only narrative of the time covering the end of the 12th century, and the only first hand account of what had come next. Furthermore, "the significance of the work as a historical source is equally matched by the insightfulness, sophistication, and stylistic brilliance of its author." As is evident by the words of Simpson, Choniates is an important contributer to Byzantine historical writing. Also being a contemporary of Cinnamus, Choniates fits squarely in the Comnenian camp of historians.

 A transitionary historian between the aforementioned Comnenian historians and the Palaiologan historians that follow is one George Akropolites (Γεώργιος Ἀκροπολίτης). He is a transitionary figure between the two because, according to Anthony Kaldellis in a review of a translation and commentary of Akropolites's work *The History*, Akropolites was "a high official of the Byzantine empire-in-exile at Nikaia [successor to a Comnenian emperor of Nicaea (Nikaia)] and then of the restored empire under Michael VIII [founder of the Palaiologan dynasty]." As a historian, once agin according to Kaldellis, Akropolites had written "the most important source for the history of the Balkans and western Asia Minor in the thirteenth century." Despite this, Kaldellis contends that modern scholarship has paid less attention to this time period and region than others in Byzantine history. As such, the work of Akropolites serves to shed light on an unfortunately overlooked subject of inquiry, potentially sparking an increased interest into its research. Again, historiography affects the perception of history, as this work of Akropolites, as important as it may be according to Kaldellis, has not done enough to keep modern scholarship interested, thereby possibly creating the idea that the topics it covers are somehow less important than they actually might be. 
 
 The first truly Palailogan historian is one George Pachymeres (Γεώργιος Παχυμέρης). Though he is largely contemporary to George Akropolites, he is labelled here as as "truly Palailogan" because his works deal largely with the Palaiologan emperors, for example, his work *De Andronico Palaeologo* dealing with Andronicus II Palaeologus. Pachymeres is notable for his impartiality, as it was largely a rarity as far as Byzantine historography goes, being that most of the works described herein are very much biased, either in favor or against, the various figures they discuss. To this end, V. Laurent (having been translated from French), states the following, "George Pachymeres, impartial as much as a Byzantine could was to be, whose honest face is almost an exception in the gallery of historians of Constantinople, has more than any of his followers suffered from the oblivion and indifference of his compatriots." By stating this, Laurent is claiming that those who followed in the impartial style of Pachymeres had faced a degree of scorn from their contemporaries. This claim is evident by the discussion of the Byzantine historians featured herein. 
 
 The next Paloiologan historian is the emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (Ἰωάννης Ἄγγελος Παλαιολόγος), who, according to Shaun Tougher, wrote his *History* as an apologetic work, defending his own actions as the Eastern Roman emperor. This is because "Cantacuzene... can be seen as contributing to the deterioration of the condition of the empire, particularly with regard to his part in two civil wars and his Ottoman policy." As such, it is obvious that in this writing, some details may have been spared, faults been downplayed, and achievements exaggerated so as to bolster his own reputation with the Eastern Roman public, and for his own personal legacy as a figure subject to the trials of time and history.
 
 The final historian to be discussed herein is one Nicephorus Gregoras (Νικηφόρος Γρηγορᾶς). Gregoras is a contemporary of Cantacuzene, and as such fits firmly into the "Palailogan" camp. As a historian Gregoras is one which represents, at the same time, traditional and non-traditional approaches to Byzantine historiography. As Teresa Hart describes his work on the Hesychast Controversy, "This work is an example of the traditional school of Byzantine historial writing in that it consists of an introductory summary of earlier history and a much fuller account of events contemporary with the author. But it departs from tradition in that it deals as much, or more, with ecclesiastical as with civil affairs." In saying this,Hart characterizes traditional Byzantine historiography as having been of practical matters relating to the state, essentially as current events being contextualized by a narrative of the past. This is in contrast with less practical, more theoretical, more philosophical, and obviously more theological, ecclesiastical history.

%}
 
In sum, Byzantine historiography can be characterized as largely having been biased in favor of one party/faction or figure over another, told in the general form of commentary on what were then civil current events, being contextualized by commentary on past events. Some historians, though far frrom the majority, did however, find themselves dedicated to impartiality. Regardless, all of Byzantine historiography has much to contribute to the depth, profundity, and intellectual merit of historiography at large.
