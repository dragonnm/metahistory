Civil War Perspectives: Different people, places, cultures and circumstances

Civil War historians were influenced by differing perspectives from the North and the South. These different people, places, cultures and circumstances formulated how this period of time in our country was recorded. We have learned studying Civil War history today that many influential individuals played important roles in how the war originated, how it was fought, and what were the true outcomes as we discover this period. Of the most notable, we recognize Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses Grant, Tecumseh Sherman, Harriet Tubmen, Andrew Jackson, Frederick Douglass, John Brown, and David Hunter Strother. Each of these individuals had different roles and responsibilities in the war effort and each came from different backgrounds, training, education, and experiences. All of these different people played a significant role on how history, events, outcomes, and lifestyles were perceived, reported and documented during this period. Political climates, military preparedness, economic conditions, and cultural views shaped how this time was recorded. Influencers on how history was documented at the time remained mostly with those from an elite status in society versus marginalized members of the community, the slaves. Circumstantially and culturally this impacted who and how history of the Civil War was documented based on the perspectives from the two sides.

## People
In the book, Enemies of the Country,  a soldier named David Hunter Strother was a Private in the Civil War for the North. “His feelings about John Brown’s trial, which he witnessed, illustrated his convocation”( Inscoe, John C., and Robert C. Kenzer. Enemies of the Country: New Perspectives on Unionists in the Civil War South. Pg. 20 )”. As a leader of an anti-slavery group, John Brown stormed the armory in Harpers Ferry.  He lead a group of people that were free slaves, slaves that he freed, white men, and many others. This caused many divisions in the United States between the North and the South.  The North saw John Brown as a hero while the the South saw him as evil and a person with the perception of Northern dominance, leading to Southerners' discussions to leave the United States. We note that John Brown played a very important role for the people living during and pre civil war times. I appreciate that the author(book 9) adds that what he did change people's views, some people revered him as a hero and others saw him as evil.

David Hunter Strother was a soldier for the Union Army. He was one of the 75,000 troops that volunteered to be called by Abraham Lincoln to stop the unifying of the Union as a nation.  He was inspired by the attack on Fort Sumter and served in the Union Army known as “Southern Unionism”. We learn that his father inspired him to join the Union army and much of his wartime experience was entangled with issues and questions about family relations. He had family loyalty uneasily coexisting with national loyalty in the hearts of even the most committed Southern Unionists. He was born in Martinsburg, in Berkeley County, Virginia (now West Virginia), in 1816. He went to Jefferson College with a study of an art degree for a short time. Before the Civil War, Strother embraced a conservaitive viewpoint that  favored law and order over the passionate fanaticism of Northern abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters. He was invited by many people that wanted to separate from the Union but he declined the offer. John Brown made an impression on him, noted from his  words upon viewing a hanging, “ No man capable of reflection could have witnessed that scene without being deeply impressed with the truth that then and there was exhibited, not the vengeance of an outraged people, but  the awful majesty of the law”( Inscoe, John C., and Robert C. Kenzer. Enemies of the Country: New Perspectives on Unionists in the Civil War South. Pg. 20)”. As we know, Virginia’s secession from the United States in April 1861 greatly troubled Strother as it did many others. He was clearly a person that reacted to his world from his life experiences and views as he knew it.

In Lincoln's inaugural address delivered on March 4, 1861. He asserted that ``The central ideal of secession” was “the essence of anarchy.” David Hunter Strother agreed with Lincoln. The struggle between what he perceived as the tyranny of the Confederacy and the lawful government of the union, Strother’s respect for order caused him to support the latter.We acknowledge the importance of this account as it shows how Strother was affected in different ways by the challenges and differences between the causes of the North and South. This perspective from this individual shows how polarizing communities became over economic status and slavery. Geography, land development, commerce, agriculture, infrastructure, transportation, innovation, industrialization, politics, and natural resources all bolstered their independent views for wealth, control, and the desire for unified states or the quest for separateness. 


## The Underground Railroad

The effort and organization of the Underground Railroad assisted many escaped slaves leave the life of struggle for a life of freedom, hope and change. The anti-slavery views in the more industrialized North gave way to supporting the slaves and their plight to freedom and justice.  We learn that the none of the slaves had easy lives working and living in the plantations in the South. There were about four million enslaved people(book 6) that lived and suffered in the southern area of the United States, skilled slave labor contributed  greatly to the economy as well as elevated slave owners social status in their communities. Also, enslaved people were status symbols, they were seen as essential for business, even though treated poorly and inhumane by many slave owners, “the third of a human law”. Slavers or the landowners would buy some of the family members, typically separating them from other family members causing great strife in addition to having poor living and working conditions. We can see that even an education was out of the question to any slave including very little legal rights in the court systems in the South.  The slaves were marinalized and left with litle or no opportunities, unfortunately, this impacted their ability to tell their stories from their point of view in the same way and volume as others representing and reporting from the time.

One of the slaves that were freed by the Under ground Railroad was Frederick Douglass. He was an activist, author and a speaker that spread the word about anti-slavey thoughts. He was one of the leaders in the “abolitionist movement”, which was the practice to end slavery during the Civil War. This was one of the most controversial topics surrounding the war, these abolutionist efforts disrupted the slave trade which affected both sides of the war. Harriet Tubmen was a critical leader in this effort that brought people out of slavery in the South to the North where there was hope for freedom and opportunities to unify their families and improve their lives. She freed an estimated 100 people out of slavery throughout her lifetime. Taubman was sought after by Southern slave owners. She impacted their livelihood by taking away their workers that made their business more challenging. The Southerner viewed slaves as an investment and their property. The Northerners overall assisted the slaves who escaped to the North, found them work, housed them and educated them. These perspectives on the law and justice for all people remained a key divider between the North and the South and obviously impressed their views on history.  

## Place
The North had an evolving robust economy industrialized and beginning to depend on the innovations of the time; the railroad, better farm equipment, and more populated communities with diverse backgrounds. Even though there were still many agricultural regions in the North, many of these gave way to more populous cities with different kinds of commerce and trade.  There were many more educational opportunities in the North based on formal structures for educating people, no matter the ethnicity of the student.  On the other hand, the South did not support education for slaves, for fear that they would gain knowledge and confidence to leave their posts in the fields and harm their economy and social status.

The South had mostly poor farmers/slave owners that only owned one to three slaves. Most people did not own any land, that meant they could not own slaves. The reason why they fought in the  Confederate States of America (CSA) is because they wanted to protect their way of life  and their states’ rights. “The plantation belt, which encompassed the South’s most fertile lands, supported a flourishing agricultural integrated into the world market for cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco. It contained the majority of slaves, as well as the planters who dominated Southern society and politics and commanded most of the regions’s wealth and economic resources. A large number of white Southerners lived in the up country, an area of small farmers and herdman who owned few or no slaves and engaged largly in mixed and subsistance agriculture. ( Foner, Eric. Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,pg. 11)”

Southern politics was mostly divided, even state politics never called into question slavery itself.“The Civil War and the destruction of slavery permanently altered  the landscape of Southern life, exposing and widening fault lines that had lain barely visible, just beneath the surface.(Foner, Eric. Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,pg. 11)”.   It is  not necessarily the search for the truth in history that is important, but rather the journey and the perspectives from narratives, documents, film, photos, prior works that provides us with the material to analyze and continue the conversation and provide additional perspectives from those before us. We gather these books and read the authors’ perspectives on the war, on slavery, on politics, on people fighting during a time of strife and struggle. It is not our place to say who was right and who was wrong as lines were drawn and lives were lost. It is interesting from a modern perspective to have  such strong sentiments regarding salvery and how that has impacted our country today. Given the “Black Lives Matter'' movement  of present, we begin to understand in a different way, in a deeper way, the struggles from the past and what this means as injustices continue today.
