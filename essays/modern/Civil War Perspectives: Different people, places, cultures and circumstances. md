Civil War Perspectives: Different people, places, cultures and circumstances


By: Francisco Raby-Mondragon


Civil War historians were influenced by differing perspectives from the North and the South. These different people, places, cultures and circumstances formulated how this period of time in our country was recorded. We have learned studying Civil War history today that many influential individuals played important roles in how the war originated, how it was fought, and what were the true outcomes as we discover this period. Of the most notable, we recognize Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses Grant, Tecumseh Sherman, Harriet Tubmen, Andrew Jackson, Frederick Douglass, John Brown, and David Hunter Strother. Each of these individuals had different roles and responsibilities in the war effort and each came from different backgrounds, training, education, and experiences. All of these different people played a significant role on how history, events, outcomes, and lifestyles were perceived, reported and documented during this period. Political climates, military preparedness, economic conditions, and cultural views shaped how this time was recorded. Influencers on how history was documented at the time remained mostly with those from an elite status in society versus marginalized members of the community, the slaves. Circumstantially and culturally this impacted who and how history of the Civil War was documented based on the perspectives from the two sides.
